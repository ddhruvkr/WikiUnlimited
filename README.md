Feed of never-ending featured articles from Wikipedia. Ideal for killing time. Made it in 2015.

Inspired by https://github.com/hackerkid/Wikifeedia. The difference though is that Wikifeedia gives random featured articles starting from the same alphabet(which is random too) whereas this gives random articles with no constraints whatsoever. Some of the code is borrowed from it. I had to change the underlying API and the way it was being utilized. 

 Will soon update more details about the implementation.
